# Web-Page-Final

Site Purpose:
  - My website is a fictious business that provides a vacationing service in the Miami, Florida area.
  
  Pages/Topics of pages:
    - I have six pages in my website concering my fictious business. They pages listed are: Home, Accomadations, Rules, About, Recreations, and Reservations.
    
    Features:
    - I provide a quick overview of what my fictious business offers in ammenities and accomadations during their stay in the Miami Area. I linked in the "Rules" page two external hyperlinks that links to the official city homepage of Miami and Local ordinances/laws concerning Miami transients or tourists. In the "Recreation" tab there's a video that demonstrates a Merlin fish hunt out in the ocean. Lastly, in the "Reservation" tab, I included an audio file for prospective customers to ponder on their reservation decision with Americana Beach Resorts!
    
    Design Decisions:
     - I want to keep the website very simple and easy to understand. First step I chose colors that closely resemble of the kind of palettes you see at a beach. Muted grey, sky blue, sandy (almond) brown background, are the colors I prioritized in my website. Vertical nav bar for ease of access must keep it simple for the user. Pictures and graphics used are again pictures you would see on a vacation to the beach, especially the merlin fish hunt because some people might've never seen one before. 
     
     Problems and Challenges encountered:
     - I ran to an issue with the nav bar, I would've liked to create buttons for it that distinctively separates them with padding. In my headers section where I provided an image that sumamrizes the page, I tried to work in the possibility of adding a image slideshow in that section clickable arrows that manipulate a more than one list of images. Attempted to integrate bootstrap so I can at least I have a feature that refrences back to the Computer System Studio class where I messed around with the <container> and <div> tags. The issues that it created when I attempted to everytime to override my established css styling for my website, even with the minimum version of bootstrap css.
  
    Knowledge/experienced gained:
      - I learned the important lesson of tracking changes and keeping a backup original folder for the project. Founding music and video features for my website required me to search for non-copyright material.
